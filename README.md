# Machine Learning Model Comparison using GridSearchCV
 
**üìå Overview:**

This project showcases a complete machine learning workflow applied to a real-world dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, train-test splitting, and the application of various supervised learning algorithms. The primary goal is to compare the performance of different models using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to identify the best-performing model based on accuracy.


**‚úÖ Models Used:**

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)



**üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, filtered invalid entries, and transformed features to make the data ML-ready.

* **Train-Test Split:** Dataset split into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.

* **Model Implementation:** Applied multiple classification algorithms using scikit-learn.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model.

* **Model Evaluation:** Compared model performance based on accuracy and cross-validation scores.
